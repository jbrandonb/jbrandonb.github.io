		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			Hi, I'm Brandon. I like building functional programs that provide value to people in the real
			world,
			in real world ways. Below are some of my best work, mostly from classes I've done. I'll continue
			to
			update them as I add to them. I'm studying for my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a focus in
			AI,
			set to graduate in Spring 2027.

				<div class="project-title">Food for You</div>
				<p>A website that I built with a team in CS290 (WebDev), and
					our goal was to make it a scalable site that allows people to keep their recipes
					for food they like.</p>

			<div class="project-card">
				<div class="project-title">Home Renovation DB</div>
				<p>A database using SQL alongside a Handlebars/CSS/JS stack to better keep track of home
					renovation projects. My wife and I were fortunate enough to partner up on this
					one in CS340 (Databases),
					and we figured this was something that would give value to people looking to do
					home projects</p>

			<div class="project-card">
				<div class="project-title">My Programming Language</div>
				<p>This is a programming language I'm writing to better learn the ins and outs of how
					programming languages
					work, as well as an outlet to do some programming that doesn't involve grades
					and due dates</p>
